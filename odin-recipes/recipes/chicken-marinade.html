<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is the best chicken marinade for grilling! 
    For tender, juicy chicken with a beautiful caramel color, this easy recipe is a must-try. 
    Don't marinate the chicken for more than 4 hours, or the lemon juice will affect the texture. 
    This is my fiancé's favorite chicken.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>⅔ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>⅔ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
    <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Mix olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, liquid smoke, mustard, pepper, 
        and garlic powder together in a large glass or ceramic bowl.</li>
    <li>Place chicken in the bowl turn to coat with marinade. 
        Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours. 
        Do not marinate longer than 4 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
    <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the 
        center and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. 
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at 
        least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
</ol>
